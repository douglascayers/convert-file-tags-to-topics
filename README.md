Convert File Tags to Topics
==============================

Overview
--------

Convert file tags to topics to use [Summer '18 Topics component](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer18/release-notes/rn_general_topics_on_records.htm) in Lightning Experience.

In Lightning Experience, file tags are not editable. Product managers have indicated that the future of tagging files will be through Topics.
This project aims to help you migrate from file tags (Classic) to file topics (Lightning).
